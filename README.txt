--> The py files needs two libraries "operator" and "json" to run.

--> Run the entire code directly. Just give the path of the working directory in the "working_dir" variable where the data is stored.
The threshold value is set as 2 which gives the maximum accuracy, but it can be changed if needed.

--> After Running the py file will generate vocab.txt, hmm.json, greedy.out and viterbi.out.

--> The Expected Runtime of the entire code is roughly 15 minutes.
